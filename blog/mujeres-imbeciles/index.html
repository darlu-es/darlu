      <p>Everyone who believes that women like jerks is convinced that they know why, but ofcourse they each have their own story. I've compiled a laundry list of hypotheses on thesubject, based on the literature, the experts, and people I
        know.</p>
      <h2>Why may women prefer assholes?</h2>
      <h3>Hypothesis 1 — Signal of extraversion and assertiveness</h3>
      <p>Women strongly prefer men who are extraverted and assertive to those who are sociallypassive. It could be that social dominance leads to social and professional success forthe man making them a desirable partner, or that outgoing and
        decisive men simplymake better lovers.</p>
      <p>1a Being an asshole is, in fact, positively correlated with assertiveness and extraversionand is thus a signal of those traits.</p>
      <p>1b Being an asshole isn't correlated but is mistaken for assertiveness and extraversion.For example, someone may strive to be the center of attention because they are sociallyskilled and popular or because they are narcissistic, and
        it's hard to immediately tellwhich is which.</p>
      <p>1c Being an asshole is a signal of high status or skills, because a loser could not get awaywith being a jerk. A weak and unpopular man would get laughed at for narcissisticdelusions or beaten up for acting like a psychopath. Thus,
        exhibiting dark triad traits is asignal that one is not a loser.</p>
      <p>1d A corollary to the "asshole as signal" theories is that women will fall for assholes less as they grow in experience and wisdom. This is the main reason why studying this on19-year-olds may be useless: women at 19 don't
        have the experience to read men'sstatus and personality well. Moreover, men sharing a college campus at 19 are veryundifferentiated, unlike later in life when women can look at stronger signals like careersuccess.</p>
      <p>When I was 19 I was nice and considerate and didn't get laid a lot with 19-year-olds.Now that I'm 33 I'm trying to be nice and considerate and I'm happily married andhaving threesomes with smart and lovely women my
        age. A few of the women I askedadmitted to falling for jerks who mistreated them while in college, and how they learnedfrom that experience to recognize assholes and avoid them.</p>
      <h3>Hypothesis 2 — Short-term mating strategy</h3>
      <p>Assholes aggressively seek out short-term mating: more casual sex, less lastingrelationships. They are more successful at it mostly because of their single-mindedpursuit of it. The downsides of dating assholes only emerge in the long term,
        when theMachiavellian's lies can't be sustained or the narcissist's volatile self-esteem swingsfrom peak to nadir.</p>
      <p>2aWomen don't like assholes but sleep with them because of selection effects — onlypsychopaths approach women aggressively at bars and clubs and it works because of thelaw of large numbers. This would be kinda funny if true
        because the sort of guy whoposts links to research papers on blogs is almost certainly the sort of guy who will neverdo well in a bar or nightclub no matter what personality he adopts.I'm the sort of guy who writes research posts, and
        none of the women I ever dated orslept with were met in a bar or nightclub. I mostly get dates through friends or myonline presence, two areas that I built up through years of long-term-oriented effort. Inthe club nothing matters beyond the
        next 30 seconds.</p>
      <p>2b Some women just want a guy for short-term mating and are choosing the assholesconsciously because they know these men will not want to hang around. What kind ofwomen?One trope that comes up often is women who have bad relationships with
        their fathersdate jerks. My evo psych take on it is that in the absence of a role model for goodfatherhood, women take the good genes in the good genes-good father tradeoff. TuckerMax's take is that "some girls need to work
        through the trauma of their daddy issueson some asshole's dick, and there's nothing wrong with that". Either way, I regret notasking about it on the survey.</p>
      <h3>Hypothesis 3 — Being an asshole is just better</h3>
      <p>The final option is that being an asshole is not a signal or a correlate of anything, it justworks better for romantic and sexual success.</p>
      <p>3a Assholes successfully manipulate women into sleeping with them and staying withthem with their dark skills.</p>
      <p>3b No manipulation needed — women just consciously prefer to date jerks and bemistreated.</p>
      <h3>Hypothesis 4 — Women actually don't prefer assholes</h3>
      <p>But some people think that they do because:</p>
      <p>4a — They're misogynists and want an excuse to be mean to women.</p>
      <p>4b — Instead of simply being nice they're being Nice Guys (TM) who objectify womenand treat relationships as transactional.</p>
      <p>4c — They confuse being high status among men (which is obviously attractive) to beinghigh status relative to your partner. The latter would imply that belittling (negging) andundermining your partner to lower their status would be a
        successful strategy.</p>
      <p>4d — They're neophyte PUAs who measure success by getting numbers at bars, andscared women readily give a fake number to pushy psychopaths.</p>
      <p>4e — They assume that guys with different norms around flirting (e.g., working-classpeople, or the French) are assholes, when in fact they're just more direct (which womenlike).</p>
      <p>4f — They derive the causation backwards, judging men who talk about their ownromantic success to be assholes because they talk about it (to less successful men).The hypotheses in this group are outside the scope of this research, but
        they're worthmentioning. Even if women don't prefer assholes at all, there are many reasons why thistrope could flourish.</p>
