      <h2>Neural annealing</h2>
<p>Michael Johnson of the Qualia Research Institute
  wrote an overview of the theory of <a href="https://opentheory.net/2019/11/neural-annealing-toward-a-neural-theory-of-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>neural
      annealing</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The metaphor comes from metalsmithing. A newly
  forged sword is ductile and tough. Then you bash the outgroup on the head with
  it and every bash creates a stress point in the sword: some part is bent, or
  stretched, or slightly cracked. Even elastic metal can't spring back perfectly
  to its original shape, and the sword becomes brittle and stiff. To restore it,
  you heat the metal to the point where its microstructure breaks down, then let
  it slowly cool and crystallize into stable unstressed patterns again.</p>
<p>Johnson, building on the work of Robin Carhart-Harris and others, proposes
  that the same process applies to brains. In the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predictive processing paradigm</a>,
  the brain starts a cycle from a stable state: neural activity is <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/12/11/predictable-identities-22-the-entropic-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-entropy</a> and proceeds in fixed
  patterns. From the inside, this feels like confidence in your models of the
  world, and consistent affect in your reaction to things.</p>
<p>As more input
  comes in, the brain accumulates stress in the form of prediction errors. This
  manifests as confusion, anxiety, or unease: a person who reacted unexpectedly to
  something you said, news that upset you, an action that failed to achieve its
  intended consequences.</p>
<p>An ideal Bayesian brain would immediately update
  all of its model in light of every new bit of information, but our brains cannot
  physiologically do that. The stress of prediction error accumulates in the form
  of electrical energy in particular neural circuits, but can't propagate
  everywhere (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/x4n4jcoDP7xh5LWLq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or even reach consciousness</a>) until
  it crosses a particular threshold of excitation. Your conscious and unconscious
  models of reality live in silos with their own accumulated errors, separated
  from the rest of the brain by potential energy barriers (Scott Alexander calls
  them <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/26/mental-mountains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mental mountains</a>).</p>
<p>To
  update, your brain needs to <em>heat up</em>, to build up too much energy at
  once to route through the habitual <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/11/20/predictable-identities-21-enlightenment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circuits of thought</a>. Meditation
  and psychedelics are powerful tools for achieving that, but anything that fills
  your brain with new and unusual inputs can do the trick like a retreat into the
  woods or "mindblowing" sex. From the inside, a brain pumped full of entropy
  feels like a trip: unusual and novel thoughts without strong affect, creative
  excitement, or nothing at all if your mind is too chaotic to make any sense of
  it at all.</p>
<p>Once past a critical point, the mental mountains flatten out
  and all the modules of the brain can "talk to each other" and update at once.
  They can settle into a new equilibrium that would globally minimize the
  prediction errors accumulated so far and those expected in the future. This
  feels like insight or enlightenment, depending on the magnitude of the
  update.</p>
<h2>Societal Annealing</h2>
<p>It's an irresistible temptation for
  anyone writing about neural annealing to apply the same model to society,
  particularly those coming from the view of an individual brain as comprising a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">society</a> of <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple agents</a>. Johnson writes
  about "social
  annealing" that happens in a shared context of religious service or sporting
  event. <a href="http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/71/3/316?fbclid=IwAR36UzFla5Lfx7-4LTr6R8N0XdUSOnbg3gnRPXn806cPKO7Zsas2EsJJhDs#sec-25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carhart-Harris and Friston</a> talk
  about psychedelics destabilizing social order and discomfiting the ruling elite
  in the same way they shake up the dominant thought patterns ruling the rigid
  brain.</p>
<p>The model, broadly speaking, is the same. Individuals in a society
  have their own worldviews and theories of reality, making their own individual
  predictions (implicit or explicit) and accumulating successes and errors. But in
  the normal course of things, good ideas don't propagate and bad ideas aren't
  dislodged very rapidly.</p>
<p>The world runs its course, people go to work and
  drink beer and watch TV regardless of the wrongness of prevailing ideologies.
  Almost everyone's lives is governed <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not by physical reality but by the social reality</a>
  around them, and unlike physical reality which is one, there can be as many
  coexisting social realities as social groups willing to courteously ignore each
  other.</p>
<p>In our brains, conscious awareness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the central stage</a> on which mental agents can
  broadcast their models to the mind at large. Communication between mental
  modules occurs outside of awareness as well, but in a much more limited
  capacity. In society, the spread and proliferation of ideas is controlled and
  gated by central sensemaking institutions: the government and mass media. In a
  world not constrained by physical reality, these institutions can spin
  narratives full of errors and contradictions that go unnoticed.</p>
<p>But once
  in a while, physical reality grabs the world by the shoulders and gives it a
  hard shake.</p>

</div>
<p>In social-reality times,
  government can make bad policy, schools can teach bad ideas, newspapers can
  print nonsense, and they would not be found out for many years if at all. In an
  exponentially growing pandemic, bad policy and fake news get found out within
  days if not hours. Ideas that held center stage through sheer inertia and
  suppression get swept away by the tide, and smart ideas that were locked in a
  dark corner can spread and propagate at the speed of Twitter.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>No matter what happens in the news, <a href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1242107268793065473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a predictable consequence</a> is political ideologists
  of all stripes will claim that the latest thing is proof of their wisdom courage
  and a complete refutation of their opponents. Progressives and conservatives,
  statists and liberatarians, are equally convinced that COVID validates their
  ideology and supports their pet policy prescriptions.</p>
<p>But I think that
  more and more people are realizing that political ideology has very little to do
  with how the state is governed. Political parties are merely coalitions of
  convenience, and the response of elected officials has nothing to do with their
  team colors and everything to do with their personality and circumstance.</p>
<p>A Republican president just signed America's largest ever welfare bill,
  approved by a Republican senate. Their Democrat colleagues supported the travel
  restrictions and border closures. <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-andrew-cuomo-pro-life-hero-20200326-pbqsrz5ugrh6nht3xmgm3cbp5q-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The governor of New York</a> is
  deservedly getting praise for his decisive and informed action while <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nevada-governor-bars-use-of-malaria-drug-for-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the governor of Nevada</a> is
  deservedly getting shit for banning doctors from prescribing hydroxychloroquine —
  they are both "moderate Democrats", and that fact has zero bearing on their
  policy decisions.</p>
<p>The same is true on a global scale. Taiwan's response
  has been exemplary and Spain's abysmal; they are both democracies. Vietnam's
  single party has managed to contain the disease so far while Iran's single party
  is digging mass graves. Elected and unelected rulers are responding to the virus
  according to their whims, personal interests, whatever advice they may or may
  not be receiving, and circumstances that are mostly outside their control.</p>
<p>I hope that this will mark a reversal in partisan polarization, and <a href="https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1243201521463902208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a marginalization of partisans</a> who continue to
  twist everything into their pet causes. Inshallah we shall see an abatement of
  the culture wars as the nature of the crisis beclowns identity politics on both
  the right and the left. But some people have been making a living stoking the
  culture war flames, and I don't think they're going to adjust well to a world of
  physical reality.</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>While political ideology seems to matter
  little in how governments respond to a real crisis, the response by many media
  outlets showed that they contain little else.</p>
<p>Opinions of a given media
  outlet usually fall into two camps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They are good people who tell
    the truth.</li>
  <li>They are bad people who lie for personal gain.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was my default implicit model — I thought of the truth I would print if
  I was a journalist, and attributed the falsehoods I saw in print to
  dishonesty.</p>
<p>In early February, when "prestige media" were churning out
  daily misinformation about the virus, <a href="https://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1226706896880455681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mason Hartman attributed their
    behavior</a> to camp #2. <a href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1226707820659269633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I noticed that I was confused</a>: wouldn't the
  personal gain come to the alarmists who get lucky? We remember the people who
  predicted the 2008 financial crisis that happened; we don't remember who
  predicted the crises of 2010, 2011, 2012 etc that didn't.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerMax/status/1226844293488357376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But then author Tucker Max responded</a>:</p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-30226" src="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tucker-max-tweet.png?w=900" alt="tucker max tweet" /></figure>
</div>
<p>At first, I thought this was just
  snark, or a too-enthusiastic application of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hanlon's Razor</a>. I know a few journalists, and they
  are intelligent and curious people. What are the chances that I just happened to
  meet the outliers of the profession?</p>
<p>But the journalists kept writing,
  and Tucker's tweet loomed larger with every article. Here's a selection from
  just one outlet which doubles as the Rationalist's official outgroup, Vox
  Media.</p>
<p><em>It won't be a pandemic, the flu is worse, travel bans don't
    work, masks don't work, keep shaking hands, only racists are scared</em> — all
  of these were reckless on the day they were written and proven false within mere
  days of publication. Nobody who is bending the truth for personal gain would
  write these articles. They were written by people who don't know what truth is,
  who lost sight of the fact that reality exists and will pass judgment on their
  articles based on physical outcomes and not pure intentions.</p>
<p>They were
  written by people who don't have the intelligence and scientific literacy to
  comprehend the mathematics of exponential growth, the physics of droplets in the
  air and on fabric, the difference between a study failing to show significance
  for <a href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1241216339261431808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an intervention</a> because of a small
  sample size and a study "disproving" its effectiveness. These "explainer"
  articles are simply pattern-matching whatever news was printed elsewhere into a
  small set of affect-laden narrative templates: orange man – bad, big government –
  good, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/23/21191147/medical-masks-coronavirus-shortage-silicon-valley-donations-salesforce-apple-facebook-tesla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silicon Valley – bad</a>. (Most major
  media outlets have stumbled onto <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/kelsey-piper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer
noopener">at least a few people</a> who start from truth-seeking and not from
  narrative matching. I wonder how these writers are feeling about their
  "colleagues".)</p>
<p>Most of these articles are neither truth nor lies, they
  have practically no information content aside from a few cherry-picked numbers
  floating free of context. You cannot learn anything by either taking Vox at face
  value or by flipping the affective sign on what they write. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qNZM3EGoE5ZeMdCRt/reversed-stupidity-is-not-intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You cannot reverse stupidity to
    produce intelligence</a>, which is another thing that a <a href="https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1242917215801946112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vox correspondent is too stupid to
    understand</a>.</p>
<h2>Novel Sensemaking</h2>
<p>Coronavirus has broken
  sensemaking for a large chunk of society. Some people interpreted events outside
  their immediate lives through a lens of partisan ideology, but partisan ideology
  turned out to be little relevant to the crisis. Some people relied on explainer
  media, but explainer media turned out to do little more than dress up partisan
  ideology in prettier language. Some people ignored world events completely, but
  now world events are making their way into your city, your job, into your
  lungs.</p>
<p>And this is the blessing of the COVID disruption — it's an
  opportunity to learn new ways of making sense of the world. We should do it the
  same way our brains do it, by seeing which models make correct predictions and
  which ones go wrong. The novelty of the situation and the speed of unfolding
  events have tightened the feedback loops between our beliefs and reality, and
  the internet allows us to update together without relying on central
  authorities.</p>
<p>This doesn't apply just to the virus itself. People are
  unlearning old ways of looking at education (was it just daycare all along?),
  the markets (aren't they supposed to be efficient?), and the actual economy (why
  can the US make space rockets but not paper masks?) People are learning new
  things about their families, friends, roommates, and landlords.</p>
<p>If you're
  feeling anxious and overwhelmed, that is a sign that the annealing has started.
  Old useless patterns have broken, entropy has replaced the semblance of order.
  But don't hide away from the confusion, use it to build new ways of
  understanding, alone and with people you trust.</p>
<p>Make predictions and
  track them, and make a note of when you were <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yashkaf/posts/10219467669335350" target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer noopener">wrong</a>. Track the implicit predictions made by
  others, and whether they admit their mistakes or refuse to update. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A/making-beliefs-pay-rent-in-anticipated-experiences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make beliefs pay rent</a>.
</p>
<p>Give
  the <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Absurdity_heuristic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">absurdity heuristic</a> a rest — the
  world is absurd. Downgrade credentials and titles, they are indicators of social
  reality. Recognize people who show tangible results, those come from physical
  reality.</p>
<p>And finally: meditate, have sex, work out, do drugs, whatever is
  available to you. Don't escape completely into Netflix and video games,
  artificial worlds designed by clever writers to be easily made sense of in
  predictable ways. Absorb information and let your brain anneal, then spread the
  word to others. The world is not any stranger today than it was a month ago. <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reality_is_normal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Since the beginning not one unusual thing has ever
    happened</a>. It is only our minds that fell behind. Now is the time to catch
  up.</p>
