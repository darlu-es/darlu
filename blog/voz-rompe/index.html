      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">The Milgram
    experiment</a> was a psychological test performed in the 1950s to testobedience
  to authority figures. Researchers were curious after the end of the secondworld
  war as to why so many people just blindly went along with the Nazis, and so
  theyperformed a test to see where the limits of obedience to authority were
  located. A test subject was told that they were responsible for delivering
  potentially deadlyelectric shocks to another test subject (actually an actor).
  The experimenter would orderthe subject to begin turning a knob which the test
  subject was told controlled theseelectric shocks. The actor would begin flailing
  and screaming and begging the subject tostop the experiment, while the
  experimenter would, first gently and then in increasinglycommanding tones, order
  the subject to continue the experiment and keep turning upthe knob. They wanted
  to see at what point the subject would refuse, and discovered to theirsurprise
  and dismay, that there was no such limit. The subject would obey theexperimenter
  and turn the knob all the way up until they had `killed' the actor.</p>
<p>This
  is how responsibility is defused unto the point of nonexistence. No oneis
  willing to take a stand, so it gets passed up the chain of command until it
  reachessomeone detached enough not to care, and at that point, it was out of
  their hands. Justfollowing orders.</p>
