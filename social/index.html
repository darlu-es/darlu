              Sin libertad de pensamiento, la libertad de expresión carece de valor, pero no prestamos atención a si lo que decimos merece ser escuchado, si es resultado de un buen razonamiento o de sentimientos que no hemos razonado, si son ideas propias o infundadas.

              I think part of the fuel behind violent protest is it’s a flex, less to one’s perceived opponents than as a psychological reminder to oneself that they have some ability, however limited, to exert control over some thing. It reassures you: “I’m not *completely* powerless.”

              After the news went on the internet, the job of the press was no longer to report new facts. Instead, all papers report the same few stories, and the bias of the reporting becomes the actual news: the press survives by telling their readers how to align themselves to the stories.
